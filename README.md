# Django-Shiny: Kubernetes hosting and authentication layer for Shiny apps

This is based on [Django Auth Server for Shiny](https://pawamoy.github.io/posts/django-auth-server-for-shiny/), but modified to use Kubernetes and [Magic Link authentication](https://github.com/pyepye/django-magiclink) (among other changes and improvements).
